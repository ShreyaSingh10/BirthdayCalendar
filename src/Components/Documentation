	- BirthdayContainer
	- BirthdatCard
	- InputArea

-I have one css file named styles.css
-I have one file storing the required data for testing
-I have one file having a function validator

What is happening in the project-

The user enter some JSON response in the text area and then eneter a year, 
upon clicking on update -> We will sort the array and then display the day on which the birthdays will fall 
in the year entered by the user
After that we will set them in the state and the cards will be able to display the data.
